      <h2>Daves Hot Chicken | Rating:10/10</h2>
      <h3>Worth the price. Chicken is always perfect and has many spice levels ranging from normal to Carolina reaper. We had the hot tenders, and she was good. Fries are basic crinkles cut with salt. Bonus point for being HALAL.

      <h3> KFC sandwich was very crispy and juicy. Fries are the best in fast food. The sauces were very good. The drinks machine didn’t work.

      <h2>Wingstop | Rating:6.8/10</h2>
      <h3>Wings are overcooked, and very hard to eat however flavors are very good. Wingstop Sandwich was not the best and was too expensive for what you get. Fries are very good, some of the best in fast food. The drinks machine works.

      <h2>Wulf Burger | Rating:6.8/10</h2>
      <h3> Good halal chicken. Overpriced AF, Dave's Hot Chicken gives more food for the price. Drinks are expensive and not big. Extra money for sauce. The Chicken Sandwich  itself is very very good.

    <h2>McDonalds | Rating:5/10</h2>
    <h3> No exciting new stuff from Mcdonald’s in a while. It is what you expect and you pay for what you get. Fries are crispy, and drinks always work, the ice cream machine works too.
